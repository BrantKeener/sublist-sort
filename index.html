  <h1>Sublist Sort</h1>
  <p>Please note that this is being served as a GitHub page without server access. 
    <br>
    The data used to build the list looks just like the response data from the database, and can be found in './public/front.js'
    <br>
    Please note that if you wish to use data from a database, a simple mySQL database can be setup with the data from front.js.
    <br>
    Add a .env file, and give it two parameters: process.env.SUBLIST_PASS, and process.env.PORT.
